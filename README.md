## 🧭 About Me

I'm a backend-focused developer who genuinely enjoys solving real-world problems with technology.

My philosophy is simple: **Write clean code, think in systems, and never stop learning**.

- 🏗️ **Current Project**: `BERU` – an internal IT Asset Management System designed to simplify asset lifecycle workflows.
- 📍 **Current Focus Areas**: Backend architecture, system design, writing testable & scalable code, exploring AI integration.
- 📚 **Learning Goals**: 
  - AI (LLMs, agents, embeddings)
  - Clean code & design patterns
  - Distributed systems (queues, caching, message brokers)
- 🤝 **Looking to Collaborate On**: Tools with real-world utility, internal platforms, AI-backed infra tools, open-source backend services.
- 🎯 **2025 Vision**: Become one of GitHub’s most consistent and disciplined backend contributors, while growing into a strong product thinker.

## 💭 Personal Philosophy

> "You don’t rise to the level of your goals, you fall to the level of your systems." — James Clear

- I believe **discipline > motivation**.
- I try to show up every day, even in silence.
- I aim to grow not just as a developer, but as a problem-solver, communicator, and teammate.
